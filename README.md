Hydronet's Multi-species Fish Habitat Model Development

The present work aims and developing multi-species models of fish distribution
in their river habitats in Canada. These models are developed using a framework
described in the present paper:

Ecography **40**: 1088–1097. https://doi.org/10.1111/ecog.02423

Model development will be performed at a smaller scale with a larger data set
and adding descriptor of flow variation obtained from a convolutional
variational autoencoder trained on the flow data.
